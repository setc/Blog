Summary: Still under construction, still trying things.

It's been, well, almost two weeks since I touched this. The problems to deploy this on GitHub pages put this project in the backburner. I know, I know, is supposed to be easy, and I'm sure it is. But it seems that there is something glaringly obvious that I don't see right now.

Anyway, there is a lot to do and right now I don't have an internet connection, so I've been studying a lot and preparing for a job interview. It's an interesting one, hope everything goes well. And about studying, a lot of Python mainly, with a little bit of Vim, emacs and MySQL on the side.

Oh, and because I have no internet I played Megaman 2. Other that the life toll in some stages is a nice game. Spent a lot of money in coffee too, to get some internet.

So far so good, time to read my notes for the interview again, iron my shirt and make that tie know. Wish me luck.
