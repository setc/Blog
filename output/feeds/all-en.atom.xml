The problems to deploy this on GitHub pages put this project in the backburner. I know, I know, is supposed to be easy, and I'm sure it is. But it seems that there is something glaringly obvious that I don't see right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there is a lot to do and right now I don't have an internet connection, so I've been studying a lot and preparing for a job interview. It's an interesting one, hope everything goes well. And about studying, a lot of Python mainly, with a little bit of Vim, emacs and MySQL on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and because I have no internet I played Megaman 2. Other that the life toll in some stages is a nice game. Spent a lot of money in coffee too, to get some internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far so good, time to read my notes for the interview again, iron my shirt and make that tie know. Wish me luck.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="blog"></category><category term="dailylife"></category></entry><entry><title>About</title><link href="/about.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-03-06T00:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Sebastian Torrente</name></author><id>tag:,2013-03-06:about.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;lorem ipsum until I get what the hell put it&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="who"></category><category term="about"></category><category term="me"></category></entry><entry><title>Example post</title><link href="/example1.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-03-05T11:00:00Z</updated><author><name>Sebastian Torrente</name></author><id>tag:,2013-03-05:example1.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We require 3 research interns to work in the exciting world of venture capital.

I have friends who'd like to know about me after all. Is also a way to keep track of things, practice my writting and in the technical side of things, getting some fun with the tweaking of the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, I wanted to open a blog but never found the right tool to do it. Yeah, there are things like Wordpress and Blogspot. And hey, they are fine choices. But I wanted something a little bit more tricky. The kind of thing that would give me fun in a "let's make it work my way" way. And Pelican was the perfect choice. Uses git as a way to make new posts, will force me to learn things like Markdown and the blogs made with it look clean. Being able to use emacs or Vim as tools to write my posts is also a good plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And nothing more to say so far. I'll try to add comments as soon as I can. Until them, there are some cover letters to write and a Linkedin profile to update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you later, and take care.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="blog"></category><category term="dailylife"></category></entry></feed>
