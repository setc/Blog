Summary: This is an example of what I am trying to do

We require 3 research interns to work in the exciting world of venture capital. Interns will research information on global venture capital funds from databases, websites, industry reports, the financial press and direct telephone contact with senior venture capital investors. 

Interns will build and manage a global investor network using social media marketing techniques. Interns will also write summary reports on venture capital funds for publication on the website.
